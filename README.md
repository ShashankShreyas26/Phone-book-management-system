# Phone-book-management-system
The given code is a C++ program for a Phone Book Management System. It allows users to create, manage, and perform various operations on a phone book, such as inserting new contacts, updating contact details, deleting contacts, searching for contacts, and displaying the phone book.

The program consists of two classes: `dnode` and `dlist`. The `dnode` class represents a node in a doubly linked list, where each node contains the contact details like name, phone number, and email address. The `dlist` class represents the doubly linked list and provides methods to perform operations on the phone book.

The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It interacts with the user and provides a menu-driven interface for performing different operations on the phone book.

Here is a brief overview of the functionalities provided by the code:

- Insert: Users can add new contacts to the phone book by providing the name, phone number, and email address.
- Display: It allows users to view all the contacts stored in the phone book.
- Update: Users can update the details of an existing contact by specifying the name and choosing the information to update (name, phone number, or email address).
- Delete: Users can delete a contact from the phone book by providing the name of the contact.
- Delete Same Name/Number/Gmail: These functions delete duplicate contacts based on the same name, phone number, or email address respectively.
- Search: Users can search for a contact by name, phone number, or email address and retrieve the corresponding details.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a Phone Book Management System using a doubly linked list data structure.
